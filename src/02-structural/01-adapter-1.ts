/* One structural design pattern that enables the usage of an existing
classâ€™s interface as an additional interface is the adapter design pattern.
To make two incompatible interfaces function together, it serves as a bridge.
This pattern involves a single class, the adapter, responsible for joining
functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.

Useful for reusing existing classes that don't have the interface we need, or when we
want to create an abstraction layer for a third-party library.

This is also called: Wrapper
